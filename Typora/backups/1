CP Editor has a great number of awesome features that made competitive programming life easy. Here, we will show you some of the most fasicinating ones, but there are still a lot of great features for you to explore!

## Editor to your preference
CP Editor is highly customizable, from global theme to editor theme, from compiler flags to run arguments, from key bindings to time limits, all aspects of your CP life are decided by you.

We know that a beautiful editor theme will surely boost your performance, so, we provide 5 different themes out of the box. If your preferred theme is not included, you are more than welcomed to file a feature request [here](https://github.com/cpeditor/cpeditor/issues). You can also produce your own theme as CP Editor is free software and its code can be read, modified and redistributed by everyone. We would be delighted if you can contribute your theme to the project!

Apart from editor theme, we also provide app-wide dark theme on certain platforms, so that CP Editor can seamlessly fit in your system.

We know, to our heart, that learning and getting used to a new keybinding is sometimes even harder than learning a new language. So nearly all commonly used features in our editor support customizable keybindings.

We know the frustration of getting rejected verdicts just because you didn't use `-Wall` and didn't caught a otherwise silly error, so we provided custom compile and run flag options for every language officially supported. Three languages, thousands of commands, all to your choice.

## Extensions to your need
CP Editor has provided support for many extensions that will make your CP life easier and faster. When others are busying themselves with fixing compile errors, copy-pasting samples and manually checking correctness, you will be preparing to submit with *CF tool* after checking your answer with *testlib* against the sample parsed by *Competitive Companion*. You will never be bothered with compile errors as they are linted by *Language Servers*, and your code is never this clean thanks to *clang-format*.

These tools in italic are all officially supported by CP Editor. Competitive companion allows you to parse sample test cases from nearly all Online Judges known to human; CF tool allows submitting to Codeforces with two clicks, clang-format formats your code while Language Server checks for errors in it, and testlib compares your output with the same checker used by problemsetters.

Say goodbye to the bulky extensions provided by common IDEs and embrace CP Editor for its extensions designed to ***your*** need.

## Designs to your taste
CP Editor comes with a simple yet powerful user interface that put everything you need right in front of your eyes. Say goodbye to searching for commands as it is just out there ready for you.

We won't be describing the awesomeness of CP Editor's designs by words as only images can fully reflect it.
