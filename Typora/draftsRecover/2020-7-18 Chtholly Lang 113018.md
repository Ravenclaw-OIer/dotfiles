# Chtholly Lang

Chtholly is a simple programming language that has rich functionalities.

## Overview

There are only two types in Chtholly: **functions** and **constants**

Correspondingly, there are only two types of statements: **function calls** and **function definitions**

Here are some example programs written in Chtholly, and their respective C++ equivalent.

```
[main (import io) (print "Hello, world")]
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world";
}
```

```
[
main (import io) (import stringutils)
	(for (set i 99) (greater_equal i 0) (subtract i 1)
		(print (cat (to_string i) " bottles of beer on the wall" "\n"))
		(print (cat (to_string i) " bottles of beer" "\n"))
		(print " Take one down, pass it around\n")
		(if (equal i 0)
			(print "No more")
		(else
			(print i)
		)
		)
		(print "bottles of beer on the wall\n")
	)
]
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 99; i >= 0; i--) {
        cout << i << " bottles of beer on the wall" << endl;
        cout << i << " bottles of beer" << endl;
        cout << "Take one down, pass it around" << endl;
        if (i == 0) cout << "No more";
        else cout << i;
        cout << " bottles of beer on the wall" << endl;
    }
}
```
